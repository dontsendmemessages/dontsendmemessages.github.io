        <h1>Hello world</h1>
        <p>This place will be my tiny island of calm. <br> I' d like to share my simple and complex thoughts and other stuff here</p>
        <p>The world is sick with its endless hate and I'm glad to be a part of it, although sometimes I realize that it gives me unbearable pain.</p>
        <p>If you were to ask me if I wanted to change anything, I would definitely say no, because I am a neutral, unbiased observer. I don't want to become part of your life, at least not to make any changes or have any influence.</p>
